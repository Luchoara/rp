      <h2>Services</h2>
      <p>
          WEBSITE_WEBSITE's matching service matches consumers with prospective insurers participating in WEBSITE_WEBSITE’s network of insurance providers (“participating insurers”). To use the service, you must complete one or more online forms that request specific information from you, including, but not limited to, your name, address, telephone number, email address, social security number, driver’s license number, banking account information, employment information, and personal references. WEBSITE_WEBSITE's collection and use of this information are subject to this site’s Privacy Policy. In order to use this website or the service, you must agree to these terms and conditions as well as the Privacy Policy, which is incorporated herein by reference.
      </p>
      <p>
          Once you submit the form(s) to WEBSITE_WEBSITE, we share your information with one or more participating insurers. By submitting the form(s), you understand and agree that you are submitting an inquiry about an insurance product to WEBSITE_WEBSITE and each of the participating insurers to whom WEBSITE_WEBSITE transmits your insurance request. By submitting the form(s), you are extending an express request to WEBSITE_WEBSITE and each of their participating insurers with whom your information is shared to contact you by any means (including, without limitation, email, telephone, and direct mail) so that they may assist you with your transaction or provide information to you about additional offers in which you may be interested.
      </p>
      <p>
          Participating insurers who receive your information from WEBSITE_WEBSITE review your information in real-time to determine whether your information meets the insurer’s insurance qualification criteria. Participating insurers may, among other things, verify your social security number, perform a credit check, and review your information against national databases that track consumer transactions with lending institutions. By submitting the form, you agree to allow participating insurers to review, verify, and research your information in such a manner.
      </p>
      <p>
          If a participating insurer determines that your application meets its insurance qualification criteria, the WEBSITE_WEBSITE website will redirect your browser to the insurer’s website. You understand and agree that, once you have been redirected to the insurer’s website, WEBSITE_WEBSITE has no further involvement. WEBSITE_WEBSITE has no involvement in the insurance application or approval process. Your subsequent interactions with the insurer are subject to the privacy policy, terms of use, and other policies and/or terms enforced by that insurer.
      </p>
      <p>
          WEBSITE_WEBSITE is not an insurer and does not make insurance or credit decisions in connection with its insurance matching service nor does it guarantee acceptance into any particular insurance program or specific insurance terms or conditions with any participating insurer. WEBSITE_WEBSITE does not guarantee that the price, product, availability, rates, fees, or any other insurance terms offered and made available by participating insurers through the insurance matching service are the best terms available in the market. WEBSITE_WEBSITE does not endorse or recommend the products of any particular insurer. It is not an agent of you or any participating insurer.
      </p>
      <p>
          WEBSITE_WEBSITE is not involved with the insurer’s use and/or review of your application information or in making a determination about whether you meet a particular insurer’s insurance qualification criteria. The insurer is solely responsible for its services to you, and you agree that WEBSITE_WEBSITE shall not be liable for any damages or costs of any type arising out of or in any way connected with your use of the insurance matching service. You understand that participating insurers may keep your application information, whether or not you are qualified for insurance with them.
