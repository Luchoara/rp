					THIS SITE
				</p>
				<p>
					By accessing Health Smart Quotes, using any of our services and/or
					accessing and using any other websites on which these Terms and
					Conditions reside (collectively also referred to herein as the

					acknowledge that you agree to and are subject to the following Terms
					and Conditions, including without limitation, binding arbitration
					(described in Section 2 below), the Health Smart Quotes Privacy
					Policy, E-Sign Consent, and any operating rules, policies, and
					procedures that may be published from time to time on this Site
					(collectively, the “Terms”). NOTE THAT THESE TERMS CONTAIN PROVISIONS
					THAT GOVERN THE RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES BETWEEN US AND YOU AND THAT
					LIMIT OUR LIABILITY TO YOU.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not access or otherwise
					use the Site or the Content. The Terms constitute a legally binding
					agreement between you and us, Health Smart Quotes, the operator of the
					Site (hereafter referred to as “we”, “us” or “our”). References in
					these Terms to “Site operator,” “we”, “us” and “our” include our
					affiliates (including, without limitation, Health Smart Quotes),
					agents, successors and assigns. The Site is available only to, and may
					only be used by, individuals who can form legally binding contracts
					under applicable law. Without limiting the foregoing, the Site is
					intended for and made available only to residents of the United
					States, age 18 or older. By accessing and using the Site, you accept
					and agree to, without qualification, the Terms and represent and
					warrant that you have the authority to bind the User (as defined
					below) to these Terms and that your use of the Site, including the
					provision or use of any Content, does not violate any applicable law.
				</p>
				<p><b>1. Our Services</b></p>
				<p>
					The Site acts as a portal to facilitate insurance agents, insurance
					companies, lead aggregators and other similar parties (each a
					“Provider”) to offer for sale and to sell, insurance and other
					products to potential consumers who have applied through the Site to
					receive insurance or other authorized quotations from a Provider
					(each, a “Prospect”), and all Prospects and potential Prospects that
					use the Site are collectively called the Site’s “Users” (and hereafter
					may be referred to as “you” or “your”). We may, with a Prospect’s
					authorization, collect certain information (a “Lead”) about a Prospect
					and sell the Lead to a Provider. We are not responsible for the
					legality, safety or quality of the products offered for sale by a
					Provider, the accuracy or veracity of the representations regarding
					the products, the ability of Providers to sell the products or the
					ability of Prospects to pay for the products. For all purposes we are
					an independent contractor.
				</p>
				<p>
					With the exception of certain life insurance transactions, we do not
					issue insurance contracts or bind coverage. We are not responsible
					for, nor do we assume any financial or other liability whatsoever, for
					the conduct of any Prospect or Provider. With the exception of certain
					life insurance transactions, we do not endorse or recommend any
					Providers or insurance policies or other related products offered by
					such Providers. With the exception of certain life insurance
					transactions, we do not provide any type of insurance, tax, financial,
					legal or any other advice. We do not guarantee that any Providers to
					whom we send a Prospect’s application will contact the Prospect or
					agree to provide the Prospect with the requested insurance coverage.
					If you would like personal advice or insurance specific policy
					recommendations, please consult with a qualified professional. Be
					advised that we do not offer or sell any insurance or other products
					shown on the Site.
				</p>
				<p><b>2. Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration</b></p>
				<p>
					PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS. You agree to
					attempt in good faith to settle any dispute or claim that has or may
					arise between us, which arises out of or relates in any way to these
					Terms or your use of the Site or the Content, including, without
					limitation, any dispute or claim between you and a Provider (each, a
					“Claim”), by way of consultations between you and us, which
					consultations will be initiated upon written notice by any party to
					the other (the “Consultation Notice”). The Consultation Notice must
					describe the nature and basis of the Claim and set forth the specific
					relief sought (“Demand”). If such Claim cannot be resolved within
					thirty (30) days after the Consultation Notice is received, any party
					to the consultations may initiate an arbitration proceeding upon
					written notice to the other party in accordance with this Section 2.
					Any notice to us under this Section 2 should be addressed to:
					info@HealthSmartQuotes.com (“Notice Address”).You agree to arbitrate
					all Claims between you and us, or any Provider, that cannot be
					amicably resolved in accordance with the foregoing paragraph. This
					agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted.
				</p>
				<p>
					It includes, but is not limited to: (a) claims arising out of or
					relating to any aspect of your relationship with us, whether based in
					contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal
					theory; and (b) claims that could be alleged as class action Claims
					(and you agree to waive the right to participate in a class action in
					accordance with this Section 2). For the avoidance of doubt,
					references in this Section 2 to “Site operator,” “Provider,” “we”,
					“Prospect”, “you,” and “us” include our respective subsidiaries,
					affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors
					and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or
					beneficiaries of the services, information or Site Content available
					through the use the Site. This arbitration agreement does not preclude
					you from bringing an individual action in small claims court if your
					claims qualify, and so long as the matter remains in such court and
					advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis.
					Further, this arbitration agreement does not preclude you from
					bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies,
					including, for example, the Federal Communications Commission or the
					Federal Trade Commission.
				</p>
				<p>
					You agree that, by entering into this arbitration agreement, you and
					we are each waiving our respective rights to a trial by jury or to
					participate in a class or representative action, and that arbitration
					of disputes pursuant to this Section 2 shall be in your individual
					capacity. THIS MEANS YOU ARE LIMITING YOUR RIGHT TO APPEAL AND ARE
					WAIVING YOUR RIGHTS TO OTHER AVAILABLE RESOLUTION PROCESSES, SUCH AS A
					COURT ACTION. THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE, COMBINE, OR JOIN THE
					CLAIMS OF OTHER PARTIES WHO MAY BE SIMILARLY SITUATED OR OTHERWISE
					PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING. You
					acknowledge and agree that the Federal Arbitration Act governs the
					interpretation and enforcement of this provision. This arbitration
					provision shall survive termination of this Agreement.
				</p>
				<p>
					The arbitration will be governed by the American Arbitration
					Association (“AAA”) under its then-prevailing rules and procedures,
					including the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related
					Disputes (collectively, the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this
					Agreement (but expressly excluding the Supplementary Rules for Class
					Arbitration and any other AAA Rules that conflict with the waiver of
					class arbitration and representative proceedings below), and will be
					administered by one (1) arbitrator with relevant industry experience
					appointed in accordance with the AAA Rules. The AAA Rules are
					available at https://www.adr.org/Rules or by calling (800) 778-7879.
				</p>
				<p>
					The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement and shall apply
					Delaware law consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act and
					applicable statutes of limitations, and shall honor claims of
					privilege recognized at law. All issues are for the arbitrator to
					decide, including, without limitation, issues relating to the
					applicability and enforceability of this arbitration agreement.
				</p>
				<p>
					Unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties to the arbitration,
					any arbitration hearings under this Section 2 will take place in the
					county where you are domiciled. If your Claim is for $5,000 or less,
					you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the
					basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic
					hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules.
					If your Claim exceeds $5,000, the right to a hearing will be
					determined by the AAA Rules. Except as otherwise provided for in this
					Section 2, in any arbitration between you and us under this Section 2,
					all AAA filing, administration and arbitrator fees for any arbitration
					initiated in accordance with the notice requirements above where
					Claims for damages do not exceed $10,000 shall, at your written
					request, be paid by us.
				</p>
				<p>
					Any request for payment of fees by us shall be submitted by mail to
					the AAA along with your demand for arbitration, and we will make
					arrangements to pay all necessary fees directly to the AAA. If the
					value of the relief sought is more than $10,000 and you are able to
					demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as
					compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much of the
					filing, administration and arbitrator fees as the arbitrator deems
					necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive.
				</p>
				<p>
					If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your
					Claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for
					an improper purpose, you agree to reimburse us for all monies
					previously disbursed that are otherwise your obligation to pay under
					the AAA Rules.
				</p>
				<p>
					The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in
					favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent
					necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual
					claim. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior
					arbitrations involving our other Users, but is bound by rulings in
					prior arbitrations involving the same User to the extent required by
					applicable law.
				</p>
				<p>
					With the exception of the provision in the preceding paragraph
					prohibiting class arbitration or representative proceedings, if an
					arbitrator or court decides that any part of this Section 2 is invalid
					or unenforceable, the other parts of this Section 2 shall still apply
					to the maximum extent possible. In the event that the foregoing
					prohibition on class arbitration or representative proceedings is
					deemed invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 2
					shall be null and void. The remainder of the Terms, including, without
					limitation, Section 16 (Choice of Law and Forum), will remain in
					force.
				</p>
				<p>
					You may opt-out of this arbitration provision only by written notice
					to us at the Notice Address ( info@HealthSmartQuotes.com) within
					thirty (30) days of your acceptance of this agreement, which notice
					shall include your name, address, and a clear statement that you do
					not wish to resolve disputes with us through arbitration.<br />If we
					make any change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to
					the Notice Address) during the term of your relationship with us, that
					change shall not apply to any Claim against us initiated prior to the
					effective date of the change. The change shall apply to all other
					Claims that have arisen or may arise between you and us. We will
					notify you of changes to this arbitration provision by posting the
					amended terms on the Site or by email, in each case at least thirty
					(30) days before the effective date of the changes.
				</p>
				<p>
					Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Terms, Providers
					shall be third party beneficiaries of the rights to dispute resolution
					and arbitration set forth in this Section 2, and each Provider shall
					have the right to enforce this Section 2 against Users as if such
					Provider were a party to the agreement set forth in this Section 2 in
					the event of any dispute or claim between you and such Provider based
					on or relating to any transaction or interaction between you and such
					Provider that is enabled by or arises in connection with your use of
					the Site.
