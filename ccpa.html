			<h1>California Consumer Privacy (CCPA)</h1>
			<br />
			<h4>
				This California Privacy Notice supplements the information contained in
				our general Privacy Policy and applies solely to visitors and users who
				are residents of the State of California (“consumer” or “you”).
				HealthSmartQuotes.com (“we,” “us,” “our”) adopts this notice to comply
				with the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), as amended,
				and other California Privacy laws. Any terms defined by the CCPA have
				the same meaning when used in this notice.
			</h4>

			<br />
			<h4>Information We Collect</h4>
			<p>
				We collect information that identifies, relates to, describes,
				references, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could
				reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer
				or household (“personal information”). Personal information does not
				include publicly available information, de-identified information,
				aggregate information, or any information protected by other privacy
				laws and otherwise excluded from the scope of the CCPA.
			</p>

			<p>
				This table identifies the categories of personal information we have
				collected about consumers within the last 12 months:
			</p>

			<br />
			<h4>Personal information does not include:</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Publicly available information, which for purposes of the CCPA:
					<ul>
						<li>
							Means information that is lawfully made available from federal,
							state, or local government records.
						</li>
						<li>
							Does not mean biometric information collected by a business about
							a consumer without the consumer’s knowledge.
						</li>
						<li>
							Does not include data used for a purpose that is not compatible
							with the purpose for which the data is maintained and made
							available in the government records or for which it is publicly
							maintained.
						</li>
						<li>
							Does not include consumer information that is de-identified or
							aggregate consumer information.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					Information excluded from the CCPA’s scope, like:

						<li>
							Medical information governed by the California Confidentiality of
							Medical Information Act (CMIA); protected health information

							of 1996 (HIPAA) and the Health Information Technology for Economic
							and Clinical Health Act (HITECH); and information collected as
							part of a clinical trial subject to the Federal Policy for the
							Protection of Human Subjects.
						</li>
						<li>
							Personal information covered by certain sector-specific privacy
							laws, including the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), the
							federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), the California Financial
							Information Privacy Act (FIPA), and the Driver’s Privacy
							Protection Act of 1994 (DPPA).

			<h4>Your California Privacy Rights and Choices</h4>
			<p>
				If you are a California resident, the CCPA provides you with additional
				rights regarding our use of your personal information. This section
				describes your CCPA rights and explains how to exercise those rights.
			</p>

			<br />
			<h5>(1) Right to Access Your Information</h5>
			<p>
				You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to
				you about our collection and use of your personal information during the
				12-month period preceding your request. Once we receive and verify your
				request, we will disclose to you the information that you request and we
				are obligated to provide under the CCPA, which may include:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					The categories of personal information we have collected about you;
				</li>
				<li>
					The categories of sources from which we collected your personal
					information;
				</li>
				<li>
					Our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling your
					personal information;
				</li>
				<li>
					The categories of personal information we have disclosed for a
					business purpose or sold about you;
				</li>
				<li>
					The categories of third parties with whom we share or sell your
					personal information; and
				</li>
				<li>
					The specific pieces of personal information we have collected about
					you.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<br />
			<h5>(2) Right to Request Deletion</h5>
			<p>
				You have the right to request that we delete some or all of the personal
				information that we have collected from you, subject to certain
				exceptions. Once we receive and verify your request, we will delete (and
				direct our service providers to whom we have furnished that information
				to also delete) your personal information from our (and their) records.
				With respect to the exceptions, we may deny your deletion request in
				whole or in part if retaining your personal information is necessary for
				us or our service providers to:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal
					information, provide a good or service that you requested, take
					actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing
					business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with
					you;
				</li>
				<li>
					Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive,
					fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for
					such activities;
				</li>
				<li>
					Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing
					intended functionality;
				</li>
				<li>
					Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise
					their free speech rights, or exercise another right provided for by
					law;
				</li>
				<li>
					Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act;
				</li>
				<li>
					Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or
					statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other
					applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information’s deletion
					may likely render impossible or seriously impair the research’s
					achievement, if you previously provided informed consent;
				</li>
				<li>
					Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with your
					expectations based on your relationship with us;
				</li>
				<li>Comply with a legal obligation; or</li>
				<li>
					Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are
					compatible with the context in which you provided it.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<br />
			<h5>(3) Right to Opt-Out</h5>
			<p>
				You have the right to direct us not to sell your personal information to
				third parties. Any personal information about you that we sell to a
				third party cannot be sold by that third party unless you have received
				explicit notice and are provided with an opportunity to opt-out of the
				sale of your personal information.
			</p>
			<p>
				You (or your authorized representative) may submit your request to
				opt-out by using the form available on this page.
			</p>

			<br />
			<h4>Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights</h4>
			<p>
				To exercise the access, data portability, deletion, and opt-out rights
				described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by
				either:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Using the form available on this page</li>
				<li>Emailing us at info@HealthSmartQuotes.com</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Only you or a person registered with the California Secretary of State
				that you authorize to act on your behalf may make a verifiable consumer
				request related to your personal information. You may also make a
				verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.
			</p>
			<p>
				You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data
				portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer
				request must:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you
					are the person about whom we collected personal information or an
					authorized representative. This includes your or the consumer’s:
					<ul>
						<li>Name</li>
						<li>Address</li>
						<li>Email</li>
						<li>Current Mailing Address</li>
						<li>Alternate Phone</li>
						<li>Alternate Mailing Address</li>
						<li>Other personal information about you maintained by us.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to
					properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Generally, we will not request additional information from you for
				purposes of verification. If, however, we cannot verify your identity
				from the information already maintained by us, we may request additional
				information from you, which shall only be used for the purposes of
				verifying your identity and seeking to exercise your rights under the
				CCPA, and for security or fraud prevention purposes. We will delete any
				new personal information collected for the purposes of verification as
				soon as practical after processing your request, except as required to
				comply with the CCPA.
			</p>
			<p>
				We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal
				information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the
				request and confirm the personal information relates to you. Making a
				verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account
				with us. We may require authentication that is reasonable in light of
				the nature of the personal information requested and will only use
				personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify
				the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.
			</p>
			<p>
				Please note that we may continue to share your personal information with
				our affiliates and service providers for essential purposes described
				above and other such circumstances allowed under the CCPA. Opting out of
				the sale of personal information through the “Do Not Sell My Personal
				Information” link does not mean that you will stop seeing ads, including
				some interest-based ads. To learn more about interest-based advertising
				across sites and additional opt-out choices, please see our general
				Privacy Policy.
			</p>

			<br />
			<h4>Use of an Authorized Agent</h4>
			<p>
				If you use an authorized agent to submit a request to know or a request
				to delete, we may require that you provide the authorized agent with
				written permission and require the authorized agent to verify its own
				identity with us.
			</p>
			<p>
				A power of attorney to your authorized agent is an acceptable form of
				authorization.
			</p>
			<p>
				We may deny a request from an agent that does not submit proof that they
				have been authorized by you to act on your behalf.
			</p>

			<br />
			<h4>How we Verify your Request</h4>
			<p>
				When you submit a request to delete, or a request to know, we verify
				your request by taking the following steps:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					We may match the information you provided in your request with the
					personal information of the consumer already maintained by us; or
				</li>
				<li>
					We may use a third-party identity verification service that complies
					with the CCPA.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>When verifying a request, we consider the following factors:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					The type, sensitivity, and value of the personal information collected
					and maintained about you;
				</li>
				<li>
					The risk of harm to you posed by any unauthorized access or deletion;
				</li>
				<li>
					The likelihood that fraudulent or malicious actors would seek the
					personal information;
				</li>
				<li>
					Whether the personal information to be provided by you to verify your
					identity is sufficiently robust to protect against fraudulent requests
					or being spoofed or fabricated;
				</li>
				<li>The manner in which we interact with you; and</li>
				<li>The technology is available for verification.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				When you request to know categories of personal information, we verify
				your identity to a reasonable degree of certainty.
			</p>
			<p>
				When you request to delete, we verify your identity to a reasonable
				degree or a reasonably high degree of certainty depending on the
				sensitivity of the personal information and the risk of harm to you
				posed by unauthorized deletion.
			</p>
			<p>
				In all cases, we verify by matching the identifying information provided
				with the request to the personal information of the consumer already
				maintained by us.
			</p>

			<br />
			<h4>Response Timing and Format</h4>
			<p>
				Upon receiving a request to know or a request to delete, we will confirm
				receipt of the request within 15 days and provide information about how
				we will process the request.
			</p>
			<p>
				We strive to respond to a verifiable consumer request within 45 days of
				its receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you
				of the reason and extension period in writing. We will deliver our
				written response by mail or electronically, at your option.
			</p>
			<p>
				Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding
				the receipt of the verifiable consumer request. The response we provide
				will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if
				applicable. For these requests, we will select a format to provide your
				personal information that is readily usable and should allow you to
				transmit the information from one entity to another entity without
				hindrance.
			</p>
			<p>
				We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer
				request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If
				we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we
				made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before
				completing your request.
			</p>

			<br />
			<h5>(4) Right to Non-Discrimination</h5>
			<p>
				We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your rights
				under the CCPA. For example, we will not:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Deny you goods or services.</li>
				<li>
					Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including
					through the use of discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.
				</li>
				<li>
					Provide you with a different level or quality of goods or services.
				</li>
				<li>
					Suggest that you will receive a different price or rate for goods or
					services or a different level or quality of goods or services.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Please know that we may charge you a different price or rate or provide
				a different level or quality of goods or services if that difference is
				reasonably related to the value provided to you by your personal
				information.
			</p>

			<br />
			<h4>Changes to Our Privacy Notice</h4>
			<p>
				We reserve the right to amend this privacy notice at our discretion and
				at any time. When we make changes to this privacy notice (which will be
				updated at least once every 12 months), we will notify you through a
				notice on this page: Privacy Policy.
			</p>
